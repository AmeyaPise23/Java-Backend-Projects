# Java Backend Projects

This repository showcases two Java-based backend projects demonstrating proficiency in Java, Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Security), and PostgreSQL. These projects are designed with scalability and real-world applications in mind, making use of RESTful principles, layered architecture, and secure access control.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring MVC**
- **Spring Security**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Maven**
- **JPA/Hibernate**
- **REST API Design**
- **Lombok** (for reducing boilerplate code)
